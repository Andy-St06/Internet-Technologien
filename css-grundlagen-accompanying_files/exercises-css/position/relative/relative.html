        <p>Water's Lewis base character makes it a common ligand in transition metal complexes, examples of which include metal aquo complexes.  In solid hydrates,  water can be either a ligand or simply lodged in the framework, or both.  Thus, FeSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O consists of [Fe<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> centers and one "lattice water". Water is typically a monodentate ligand, i.e., it forms only one bond with the central atom. When the addition of water to an organic molecule cleaves the molecule in two, hydrolysis is said to occur. Notable examples of hydrolysis are the saponification of fats and the digestion of proteins and polysaccharides. Water can also be a leaving group in S<sub>N</sub>2 substitution and E2 elimination reactions; the latter is then known as a dehydration reaction.<sup>[86]</sup>
